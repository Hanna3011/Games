# Games
Games in Python produced by myself
-----------

### In this repository I present a few python files, which show results of my learining.
### They are games written in Pyton3. Most of them uses English, but in some cases I used also polish names and it was intentional action :) (e.g. wisielec.py dedicated for polish people).

-----------------
### I hope you will enjoy my little games. I'm award that I'm still at starting point in my programming adventure, but I'm very excited about it and I will be very thankful for each of your suggestion how to develop my code.
